## Purpose

Final project for EKHM63 Growth over Space and Time.

*The aim of the assignment is to apply theoretical concepts and approaches of economic geography to a regional example of your own choice. Pick up a region and, based on the course literature, lectures and additional available information, write an individual paper (3000 words ±10%) in which you:

1. Summarize economic growth pattern in the selected region since year 2000 (or earlier, if possible), position it within the national growth cycle, and relate to the literature on (regional) economic cycles;

2. Discuss how the current state of regional economy in the selected region (with respect to industry structure, local institutions, etc.) frames opportunities and limitations for its future development; 

3. Based on the discussion of prior growth pattern and future growth opportunities in the selected region, prepare a short policy brief with recommendations to policy makers on how to create a more favorable environment for future growth and development.

The first two parts are expected to account for 2500 words (±10%). You can structure your discussion of previous growth patterns and future growth opportunities as a single story or separately. The policy brief should account for remaining 500 words (±10%) and be separated from the discussion above.*

## Process

Gotta finish tomorrow!
